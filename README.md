You are working on a RPG which is based in a Fantasy setting. It has been
decided that you need a tool which will generate ambient audio tracks to
make the player feel like they are in the environment. The player will visit forests,
towns and caves.
***
This breaks down into the following sections:

Forests 
------
	There will be a number of ambient sounds within a forest environment that need to be generated, these
	include things such as; birds, leaves russeling, rives/ streams, animals etc.
Towns
------
	There will be a number of ambient sounds within a settlement that need to be generated, these things 
	include things such as; people, walking, horses, bustling crowds, fire(lanterns etc.), markets, rivers,
	rain, blacksmith, birds etc.
Caves
------
	There will be a number of ambient sounds within a cave that need to be generated, these things include
	things such as; dripping, empty noise, roars, fire, rockslides, falling rocks, collapses, echos, bats,
	etc.
